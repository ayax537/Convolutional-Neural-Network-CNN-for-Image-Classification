# Convolutional-Neural-Network-CNN-for-Image-Classification
This Python script implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras for classifying images into different categories. The model is designed to process images of various densities, specifically for distinguishing between benign and malignant cases in a medical imaging context.
